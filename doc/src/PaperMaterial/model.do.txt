===== Level crossing and entanglement in a simple  solvable model =====


In order to study the importance of intruder states, we let
our hamiltonian depend linearly on a strength parameter $\lambda$
!bt
\[
       H=H_0+\lambda H_1,
\]
!et
with $\lambda \in [0,1]$, where the limits $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$ represent the 
non-interacting (or unperturbed) and fully interacting system, respectively.
The model is an eigenvalue
problem with only two available states, which we label
$P$ and $Q$. Below we will let 
state $P$ represent the model-space
eigenvalue whereas state $Q$ represents 
the eigenvalue of the excluded space.
The unperturbed solutions to this problem are
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\Phi_P =\epsilon_P\Phi_P
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\Phi_Q =\epsilon_Q\Phi_Q,
\end{equation}
!et
with $\epsilon_P < \epsilon_Q$. We label the off-diagonal
matrix elements $X$, while $X_P=\bra{\Phi_P}H_1\ket{\Phi_P}$ and
$X_Q=\bra{\Phi_Q}H_1\ket{\Phi_Q}$.
The exact eigenvalues problem
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}\epsilon_P+zX_P &zX \\
zX &\epsilon_Q+zX_Q \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
!et
yields
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
     label{eq:exact}
     E(z)=&\frac{1}{2}\left\{\epsilon_P +\epsilon_Q +zX_P
     +zX_Q \pm \left(
     \epsilon_Q -\epsilon_P +zX_Q-zX_P\right) \right. \\ \nonumber
     & \left. \times\sqrt{1+\frac{4z^2X^2}{\left(
     \epsilon_Q -\epsilon_P +zX_Q-zX_P\right)^2}}
     \right\}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et
An RS expansion for the lowest
eigenstate (defining states $P$ and $Q$ as the model and excluded
spaces, respectively) can be obtained by expanding the lowest
eigenvalue as
!bt
\begin{equation}
      E=\epsilon_P +zX_P+\frac{z^2X^2}{\epsilon_P -\epsilon_Q}+
      \frac{z^3X^2(X_Q-X_P)}{(\epsilon_P -\epsilon_Q)^2}+
      \frac{z^4X^2(X_Q-X_P)^2}{(\epsilon_P -\epsilon_Q)^3}
      -\frac{z^4X^4}{(\epsilon_P -\epsilon_Q)^3}+\dots,
      \label{eq:modela}
\end{equation}
!et
which can be viewed as an effective interaction for state $P$ in which
state $Q$ is taken into account to successive orders of the perturbation.
In this work we choose the parameters $\epsilon_P=0$, $\epsilon_Q=4$,
$X_P=-X_Q=3$ and $X=0.2$. The exact solutions
given by eq.\ (ref{eq:exact})
are shown in fig.\ 1 as functions of the
strength parameter $\lambda$. Pertinent to our choice of
parameters, is that at $\lmabda\geq 2/3$,  the lowest eigenstate is
dominated by $\Phi_Q$ while the upper is $\Phi_P$. At $\lambda=1$ the
$\Phi_P$ mixing of the lowest eigenvalue
is $1\%$ while for $z\leq 2/3$
we have a $\Phi_P$ component of more than $90\%$.
The character of the eigenvectors has therefore been interchanged
when passing $z=2/3$. The value of the parameter $X$ represents the
strength of the coupling between the model space and the excluded space.
Thus, this simple

# QuantumProject (quantum engineering, how to make quantum computers that work)
## Develop FCI code for ion traps and quantum dots
   - MHJ's code
   - Yoshida and Shimuzu https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08256
   - Set up mtx elements (one-body and twobody) in uncoupled basis for 2d quantum (3d and 1d systems). 
   - Ã˜yvind's 3 and 4 particle code
   - Veronika's master thesis, FCI for quantum dots
   - Simen Kvaal's FCI code https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2644
   - Effective interaction for many particles and FCI
   - Time development
   - Adiabatic(?) switching on/off of Coulumb interaction
## Basis sets
   - DVR basis
   - Is the basis 'the same' after and under a perturbation?

## Operations on qubits
   - Suggestions for circuits with given gates, how to make fields that perform different operations
   - Model hamiltonians and observables
   - Lowering and raising of wells and gates
## Von Neumann Entropy and Entanglement
   - 1d systems with two and more particle
   - 2d systems with two electrons in two wells
   - 3d system with two electrons in two wells
   - Move to three electrons (qd) and four electrons
## From FCI to many-body methods with time dependence
   - Academic exercise: ground state evolution with time-dependence
